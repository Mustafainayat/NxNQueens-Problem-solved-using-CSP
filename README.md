# NxNQueens-Problem-solved-using-CSP
# concepts of CSP should be clear before jumping into details and working.
# this code currently is created dynamically by setting n = 8 (8x8 Queens problem)
# requirement is that your system should randomnly assign the first queen and shrink domain for other queens and assign other queens accordingly until all other queens are assigned!
# this code does forward checking also! and backtracks the chessboard when a queen does not have any domain left!
# this is done by using recursion technique!
